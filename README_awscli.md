# AWS CLI Installation (Optional)

This project does not require a bundled AWS CLI. Please install AWS CLI v2 using the official instructions:

- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html

All scripts and automation assume `aws` is available in your PATH. The `aws/` directory is not required and has been removed for clarity.
